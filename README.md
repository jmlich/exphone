exPhone is a straightforward call-blocking app for Ubuntu Touch. It lets you manage a custom list of phone numbers that are instantly rejected, keeping spam and unwanted calls at bay.

Currently, it operates completely offline—no online blacklists or external services involved.

To make things even easier, exphone creates its own call history. You don’t need to rewrite phone numbers manually—just select a number from the history and enable blocking.
